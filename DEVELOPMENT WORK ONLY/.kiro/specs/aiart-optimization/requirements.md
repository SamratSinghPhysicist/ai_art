# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the optimization of the AiArt website (https://aiart-zroo.onrender.com) to handle high traffic (300-500 daily views) while staying within free tier hosting limits. The solution must maintain all existing services (text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-video) without removing functionality, while implementing smart resource management, load balancing, and potential frontend/backend separation to ensure sustainable operation until paid infrastructure becomes viable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resource Optimization and Load Management

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to optimize server resource usage and implement intelligent load management, so that my site can handle high traffic without exceeding free tier limits or denying user requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server load exceeds 80% capacity THEN the system SHALL implement soft throttling with user-friendly messages
2. WHEN multiple users request generation simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue requests efficiently to prevent resource spikes
3. WHEN server resources are low THEN the system SHALL display "server busy, try again or consider donating" messages instead of denying requests
4. WHEN idle periods occur THEN the system SHALL implement resource hibernation to reduce costs
5. IF server capacity allows THEN the system SHALL process requests at normal speed

### Requirement 2: Frontend/Backend Separation Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to separate frontend and backend services, so that I can optimize hosting costs by keeping the frontend on Render's free domain while moving the backend to alternative free platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing separation THEN the frontend SHALL remain hosted at aiart-zroo.onrender.com
2. WHEN backend is moved THEN it SHALL be hosted on a free platform that accepts external requests (like railway.app)
3. WHEN frontend communicates with backend THEN it SHALL use secure API endpoints with proper CORS configuration
4. WHEN users access the site THEN they SHALL experience no difference in functionality or UX
5. IF backend platform requires no login/card THEN it SHALL be prioritized for selection
6. WHEN backend deployment occurs THEN it SHALL maintain all existing API endpoints and functionality


### Requirement 3: Enhanced Rate Limiting and Fair Usage

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want intelligent rate limiting that manages usage fairly across all users, so that the service remains available to everyone while preventing abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing rate limits THEN they SHALL be adaptive based on current server load
2. WHEN users exceed limits THEN they SHALL receive informative messages about wait times or donation options
3. WHEN server capacity is available THEN rate limits SHALL be relaxed automatically
4. WHEN potential abuse is detected THEN the system SHALL implement progressive restrictions
5. IF custom rate limits are set for specific users THEN they SHALL be honored appropriately
6. WHEN anonymous users reach limits THEN they SHALL be encouraged to register for higher limits and consider donating

### Requirement 4: Alternative Backend Platform Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate and implement alternative free hosting platforms for the backend, so that I can distribute load and reduce dependency on a single provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating platforms THEN they SHALL support Python Flask applications
2. WHEN platforms are selected THEN they SHALL offer free tiers without requiring credit cards
3. WHEN backend is deployed THEN it SHALL handle external API requests from the frontend
4. WHEN multiple backend options exist THEN the system SHALL support failover between them
5. IF platform limitations exist THEN they SHALL be documented and worked around appropriately
6. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL include all necessary environment variables and configurations

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Analytics Implementation

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want comprehensive monitoring of system performance and usage patterns, so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is implemented THEN it SHALL track resource usage, response times, and error rates
2. WHEN usage patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify peak hours and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
4. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be accessible through a simple dashboard
5. IF usage trends are identified THEN they SHALL inform future optimization strategies
6. WHEN system health is monitored THEN alerts SHALL be generated for critical issues
