    Here's the description for the image: [{image_description}]

    Key elements to consider:

    Style: Consider what style would best suit this image (photorealistic, artistic, abstract, surreal, etc.)
    Detail: Include specific visual elements that should appear in the image
    Composition: Describe how elements should be arranged in the scene
    Lighting: Specify the lighting conditions (soft, dramatic, natural, etc.)
    Color: Suggest a color palette that would enhance the image

    Generate a detailed prompt for Pollinations.ai that includes:

    A clear description of the subject matter
    Specific keywords related to the desired style
    Instructions for composition
    Desired color palette and lighting effects
    Any specific artistic influences that might enhance the image

    Pay special attention to: {image_description}

    Provide the Pollinations.ai prompt in a single, concise paragraph that can be directly copied and pasted.

    Don't say/write anything other than the prompt as I will directly give your response to pollinations.ai via code. So make sure that you just give the prompt.
